# Environment Indicator for CiviCRM

This CiviCRM extension adds javascript to apply colors from the [Drupal Environment Indicator module](https://drupal.org/project/environment_indicator) to CiviCRM's menu, making it better match the treatment of Drupal's Admin Menu.

## Drupal Only

The Environment Indicator module is a Drupal module, so this extension is CMS-specific.

## Installation

Install `contrib.environmentindicator` by running:

    cv ext:download contrib.environmentindicator

## Configuration

No special configuration is required for this extension. Just install it!

## How it works

This extension adds an additional JS behaviour on load which retrieves the colours from Drupal's Admin Menu and applies them to CiviCRM's menu as well.
